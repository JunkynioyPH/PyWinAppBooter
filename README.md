A PyQt6 GUI which indexes an ntpath and makes a Button GUI to pick which app to launch:
- **os.system("START '' '.\path\to\file.*'")**, in Linux, Proton. 

Yes, there is a thing called **virtual desktop** in proton, but I use steam and have steamtinkerlaunch.

Yes, steamtinkerlaunch can launch in **virtual desktop**, but I assume it needs an executable so it will auto fail. (???)

But, I don't need a full blown **Desktop**; It doesn't auto-start **File Explorer** out of the box.

I just need a GUI, presenting me what I can Launch/Open, Click, Boom, Starts.
