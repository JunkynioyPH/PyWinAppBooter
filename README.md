I use steam for pretty much everything i run on linux, a "SteamDeck at home" type shii but i have a nuke pc.

A PyQt6 GUI App, compiled to **.exe** with PyInstaller, which indexes an ntpath and makes a Button GUI to pick which app to launch:
- **os.system("START '' '.\path\to\file.*'")**, in Linux, Proton. 

I just don't want to have to add a new non-steam app each time which makes a brand new profile each time I want to run an app for 2 seconds.

"Just install system-wide wine" ok, you do that. This is more fun for me and I learn and enjoy making the stuff 😊.

Yes, there is a thing called **virtual desktop** in proton, but I use steam and have steamtinkerlaunch.

Yes, steamtinkerlaunch can launch in **virtual desktop**, but I assume it needs an executable so it will auto fail. (???)

But, I don't need a full blown **Desktop**; It doesn't auto-start **File Explorer** out of the box.

I just need a GUI, presenting me what I can Launch/Open, Click, Boom, Starts.
